# Code Katas

This repository is a personal archive of **daily code katas** aimed at reinforcing my understanding of key programming fundamentals. Each kata is a small, focused exercise that helps me grow as a developer through repetition and reflection.

## Goals

- Build a consistent habit of daily practice and self-improvement.

## Topics Covered
